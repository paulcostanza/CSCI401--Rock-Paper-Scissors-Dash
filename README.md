## Prerequisite

Make sure to have:
- React: the frontend library that breaks up the code into *components*, allowing us to break the project up a lot easier. 
- Vite: a build tool that helpsthe application run quickly and efficiently.

## How to download the code

1. <code>fork</code> this repository (repo)
2. clone the repo to your working environment

To run from your machine while coding:

```bash
npm run dev
```

To trigger GitHub WorkFlow:

```bash
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

## To save work

Check the current status of what git has saved or not saved
```bash
git status
```

Add what you would like to *commit*

```bash
git add .
```

The <code>.</code> represents all files. If you want to only *commit* specific files, you can list them individually. 

Now commit
```bash
git commit -m "whatever message you want to add to keep track of the commit"
```

And add it to the project:

```bash
git push origin main
```
